# Italki Class Assistant

This script / repo is to quickly look up words in different target languages as I am talking with my teachers on Italki ðŸ’ª

It uses [Googletrans](https://py-googletrans.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) but note that due to [an issue](https://github.com/ssut/py-googletrans/issues/383) it uses [a pre-release](https://pypi.org/project/googletrans/3.1.0a0/)

To use it make a virtual environment (Unix: `python -m venv venv && source venv/bin/activate`) and install the requirements (`pip install requirements.txt`), then:

```
python gui.py
```

Enjoy ðŸ˜Ž and boost your language learning ðŸ“ˆ
